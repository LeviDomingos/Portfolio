# Portfolio website - **Project Number One**

This is my first assignment or project as FrondEnd student. The website will reflect the knowledge that I have accumulated  so far. 

Visitors will be able to find personal information about me. They will also notice the simplicity of the website, nothing to complex. 

## Wireframe
To draw my website I used “Balsamiq.” I want to show how responsive the website can be when tested on different devices. Those are the  links to the wireframes:

2.![alt text](../wireframes/desktopcontactpage.png)

4.![alt text](../wireframes/mobilehomepage.png)


## Features
The menu is the same throughout the pages; home, contact, and about me. 

# Home Page
The home page is a brief introduction ==of my 20 years journey learning different technology==. The page display my journey in two columns. There is a link in the main page where the visiter or user can click on and find out more about me.

## About Me Page
On about me page I describe a little bit more about myself in a concise manner.
The user will learn more about my personality. What drives me, my working ethic, ambition and so on. There is a picture of me too. 
The visiter will come across with 3 coloured stars. I got them from Font Awesome website.

## Contact Me
In the contact-me page, there is a form for the user to fill out if ver needs to reach me. The user also can get in touch with me via mobile phone. I also made my business address available too.

## Features to implement 
- I would like to make the submit form active. User could send and receive information from me.
- I also would like to create few animations with javascript, make the page more interactive

## Technology Used
**Balsamiq** - I used it to show how the website responds across different screen sizes. 

**HTML** - the 3 pages structure seats on HTM5. Very basic Layout pages. The design of the page is made with Bootstrap.

**CSS3** - To make the page more colourful, I css and bootstrap too.  

**Font Awesome** 
I inserted fontawesome elemnts in about me page only.

**Git** - used it as a version control system to add and commit changes made to my project.

**Github** -  I have used it to apply the changes on my project and display the website too.

**Testing**

My wife and I were the only one testing the site. I made the necessary changes sugested by her. The Jumbo Bar was her idea.

## Responsive Design 
To find out if my website was fully mobile friendly I used Google Chrome's Development Tools, Safari, Telephone devices to test how it looks in different 
devices and browsers. 

HTML and CSS Validation 
I used the below websites to validate the code in my website:

- [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) tool to validate my CSS code.
- [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) tool to validate my HTML code.


# Strugles to overcome

> To make a responsive design was a big “ask.” 
*I never realised* that margin and padding are taken into account on measurements. 
*Some divs were* totally off the page. 
*The height of the page* was another hurdle to overcome. 


# Mentor
My mentor directed me to the right places when needed.
